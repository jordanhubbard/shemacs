# em

shemacs — an Emacs/mg-compatible editor implemented as a single shell
function. The editor logic is written in pure Scheme (`em.scm`) and
AOT-compiled to native bash or zsh via [sheme](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/sheme).

Features include multiple buffers, undo, a 60-entry kill ring, incremental
search, query replace, keyboard macros, region highlighting, fill paragraph,
and universal argument.

**Requires [sheme](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/sheme)** (`bs.sh`) to be
installed. Install sheme first, then install shemacs.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordanhubbard/shemacs.git ~/em
cd ~/em
make install
```

`make install` automatically fetches and installs
[sheme](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/sheme) if it is not already
present — no manual pre-install step required. It then copies `em.sh`,
`em.zsh`, and `em.scm` to your home directory and adds `source` lines to
both `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`.

Reload your shell and `em` is available:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc       # or open a new terminal
em myfile.txt          # edit a file
em                     # open a *scratch* buffer
```

Because `em` is a shell function (not a subprocess), after the first-run
compile it starts instantly — there is no fork/exec overhead.

### Makefile targets

```bash
make install           # install shemacs (auto-installs sheme if needed)
make install-sheme     # install sheme only (bs.sh → ~/.bs.sh)
make uninstall         # remove copied files and source lines
make check             # syntax-check the launchers
make test              # run integration tests (requires expect and sheme)
make example           # run smoke example (requires expect and sheme)
```

### Standalone (no sourcing)

The launcher also works as a plain executable:

```bash
chmod +x em.sh
./em.sh myfile.txt
```

### First-run compile

On first run, `em.sh` / `em.zsh` compile `em.scm` to a native shell cache
(`em.scm.cache` for bash, `em.scm.zsh.cache` for zsh). This takes a moment.
Subsequent runs source the cache directly and start instantly.

If the editor behaves unexpectedly after updating sheme or em.scm, delete
the cache to force a rebuild:

```bash
rm -f ~/.em.scm.cache ~/.em.scm.zsh.cache
```

## Contributor Pre-Push Checks

Before every push, run and pass these targets from both bash and zsh shells:

```bash
make test
make example
```

## Why?

Because sometimes you just need a quick editor that feels like Emacs
without installing Emacs.  shemacs is small (~1300 lines of Scheme),
its dependencies are minimal (just sheme and a standard shell), and
once compiled it starts instantly as a shell function with no fork/exec
overhead.

## The Totally True and Not At All Embellished History of shemacs

### The continuing adventures of Jordan Hubbard and Sir Reginald von Fluffington III

It began, as so many catastrophic ideas do, with a small act of stubbornness.

The programmer had been using a server — a perfectly nice server, by server standards — that had no text editor installed beyond `vi`.  The programmer would like to be clear that this is not a moral failing on the server's part.  The server did not choose to be born editorless.  Nevertheless, the programmer typed `:q!` for the forty-seventh time, missed, and found himself staring at the bottom of a shell prompt with a half-edited configuration file and a deep, smoldering grievance.

"I could install nano," he said.

Sir Reginald von Fluffington III, who had accompanied the programmer on what the programmer had described as "a quick server-room visit" and Sir Reginald had accurately described as "inexplicable," looked up from the keyboard cable he had been attempting to eat.  He blinked once.

"I could also," the programmer continued, "write my own editor.  In bash.  It would start instantly, require no installation, and would travel with me wherever my `.bashrc` goes."  He paused.  "Like a friend.  But reliable."

Sir Reginald returned to the cable.

This was the moment.  This was the seed.  Historians, had they been present, would have quietly left the room.

What followed was six weeks that the programmer later referred to as "rapid prototyping" and his colleagues referred to as "that thing you did instead of reviewing my PR."  A terminal went raw.  Escape sequences were learned, forgotten, relearned, and in one memorable case, accidentally sent to a production server.  The kill ring emerged on a Tuesday, motivated by the discovery that bash arrays could hold arbitrary strings, and grew to sixty entries by Wednesday for reasons that remain unclear to this day.

"It's just a function," the programmer explained to no one in particular.  "A shell function.  Sourced into the shell.  Zero latency.  Like... like Emacs, but if Emacs were a perfectly reasonable person who doesn't require three separate config files to open a file."

Sir Reginald knocked a mug off the desk.  He had been building up to this for some time.

By the time the function grew past a thousand lines, it had undo.  By fifteen hundred, it had incremental search — real incremental search, with highlighting, which required the programmer to learn approximately fourteen ANSI escape codes he hadn't needed since 1993 and one he's still not entirely sure is valid.  By two thousand lines, it had multiple buffers, because of course it did.

"Keyboard macros?" said the programmer, at two thousand and three hundred lines, to Sir Reginald, who had retreated to the top of the monitor to judge from elevation.  "Obviously keyboard macros.  What is an Emacs-compatible editor without keyboard macros?  I ask you, Reggie.  I ask you rhetorically."

Sir Reginald declined to engage.  He had declined to engage for six weeks.

The finished function — approximately 2,451 lines of pure bash that functioned as a full-featured terminal text editor with multiple buffers, a kill ring, undo, incremental search, query-replace, keyboard macros, region highlighting, fill-paragraph, and universal argument — was named `em`, because `emacs` was already taken and `shemacs` was what it became when the programmer realized it needed a repository name and all the good ones were gone.

"It's elegant," the programmer told Sir Reginald, who was at this point sitting directly on top of the laptop that contained the file that contained the main rendering function.  "It sources into your shell in milliseconds.  It has no external dependencies.  It is, in a very real sense, the purest possible text editor."

Sir Reginald yawned.  He had six teeth and used all of them.

"I should port it to zsh," the programmer said.  "For the other people."

He did.  It worked.  He was unreasonably surprised.

Then, one dark and stormy evening, the programmer sat hunched over the 2,451-line mass of tangled bash functions that shemacs had become, and he had a thought.  Not about shemacs, exactly.  About something worse.

"What if I wrote a Scheme interpreter," he whispered, "in bash?"

Sir Reginald left the room.  He had seen this look before.  He didn't like where it went.

The rest of that story is documented in the [sheme repository](https://github.com/jordanhubbard/sheme), where Sir Reginald continues to withhold his endorsement, and the programmer continues to be unreasonably proud of things that arguably should not exist.
